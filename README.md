# 🎓 Student Report Card System

## 📌 Overview
The **Student Report Card System** is a Python-based command-line application that allows teachers to manage student records, marks, and grades efficiently. The system supports adding new students, updating marks, viewing report cards, and performing performance analysis like topper detection and highest scores per subject.
